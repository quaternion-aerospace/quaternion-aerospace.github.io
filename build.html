	Quaternion has the capabilities to prototype and manufacture a wide range of custom UAV aircraft. We have built custom airframes ranging from large novel configurations with take-off weights in excess of 200 lbs, to micro air vehicles weighing in at under 0.5 lb!</p>
<p>
	With acess to partner companies with a full range of CNC machines, including two 3-axis mills (4&rsquo;x8&rsquo; and 6&rsquo;x3&rsquo;), a 5axis vertical milling center and 4 axis CNC hot wire foam cutter, we have the ability to quickly prototype aircraft and associated tooling. Quaternion also fabricates composite airframes using vacuum bagging and vacuum assisted resin transfer molding techniques.</p>
<p>
	Contact us for more information on your prototyping and manufacturing needs and be sure to check out our other services to see how we can <u>Design</u>, <u>Validate</u> and <u>Operate</u> your custom UAV.</p>
