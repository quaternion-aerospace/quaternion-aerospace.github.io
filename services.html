<h5>Engineering Services</h5>
<p>Quaternion Aerospace’s team of engineers offers years of experience in design, structural dynamics, aerodynamics, aeroelasticity, multidisciplinary design optimization, wind tunnel models and flight testing.  We maintain a staff of engineers, scientists, and technicians who handle a wide range of design, manufacturing, testing and evaluation projects.  Past and present projects involve aeroelastic scaling of a joined-wing aircraft configuration; finite element modeling, analysis and validation of a “Turbo Otter” forward fuselage certification; design and feasibility analysis of an airborne measurement of an induced polarization device; topology optimization of an optical table; modeling and analysis of a helicopter bracket assembly; aero-structural optimization of a wing with morphing winglets, rapid prototyping and testing, and product design analysis.</p>
