<p>
	One of Quaternion&rsquo;s major strengths is our ability to design and optimize a wide variety of aerospace systems. We have experience in a full range of engineering tasks from aircraft conceptualization and initial sizing, aircraft configuration and layout, structures and design for manufacturing.</p>
<p>
	Our extensive suite of in-house developed tools allows a rapid turnaround bringing your aircraft from concept to reality fast. Automated tools and parametric models allow configurations to be optimized based on customer&rsquo;s mission and payload requirements, and automatic CNC toolpath generation and in-house CNC machines means tooling takes days not weeks.</p>
<p>
	Contact us for more information on your custom design needs and be sure to check out our other services to see how we can <u>Build</u>, <u>Validate</u> and <u>Operate</u> a system specific to your needs.</p>
