	Quaternion offers many services to validate and test your custom design. Testing is critical early in the design phase to reduce total time to market while producing a robust and reliable platform. Using advanced techniques such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEM) within the early stages reduces prototyping costs and time, while allowing advanced optimization techniques to be applied.</p>
<p>
	Physical testing including wind tunnel, truck top testing and ground vibration tests are all services available to quaternions customers. Additionally, we have the capabilities to flight test your vehicle on site or at locations specified by you.&nbsp;</p>
